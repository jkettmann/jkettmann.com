No matter if you're a CS or bootcamp grad or if you try to take the leap from amateur to
professional as a self-taught developer: For most of us, our career as React developer
starts with tutorials. Lots of tutorials.

Unfortunately, it's hard to find quality content. The tutorials are confusing. The instructors
don't seem to have a clue themselves. And of course, the code is outdated as hell
still using React version 15 and good old class components. Did you hear of hooks already?

So you invest a little money. You follow a Udemy course or two that promise you'll become a Senior React
dev in 40hrs for $12.99 on "discount"! ðŸš€ You buy courses by Stephen Grider, Wes Bos, ... you name them.
