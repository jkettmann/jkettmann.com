Writing software is not easy. Depending on your background you might need to adopt a whole new way of thinking.

So looking back on what you already learned you feel a little proud. Maybe your family or friends are impressed with your tech skills. Maybe they even call you a nerd. Welcome to the club ðŸ˜€

At the same time, when you write code it doesn't flow as easily as you'd like. You hate to say but what you produce looks more often than not like the famous blob of spaghetti code. Is this really readable? Maintainable?

When you run into a problem you don't really know where to start debugging. You stab around in the dark until you find a solution. But that often takes hours or even longer.

You know that you can level-up and become a real pro. But here you are still feeling like an amateur.

## What if you had help learning professional developer skills?

It would be so much easier to improve your code. You could refactor the mess to become clean and DRY. You'd feel so much more confident in your coding skills. And finally, you could feel proud to share your code with others.

If you had some guidance in debugging your applications you could keep a clear mind when running into yet another problem. You could track down bugs in no time.

It would be great to have these skills, sure. And of course, it would take time. But how are you supposed to level-up with all this superficial content out there?
