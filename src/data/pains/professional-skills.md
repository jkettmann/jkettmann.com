Writing software is not easy. Depending on your background you might need to adapt a whole new way of thinking.

So looking back on what you already learned you feel a little proud. Maybe your family or friends are impressed with your tech skills. Maybe they even call you a nerd. Welcome to the club ðŸ˜€

At the same time, when you write code it doesn't flow as easily as you'd like. You hate to say it but what you produce looks more like the famous blob of spaghetti code. Is this really readable? Maintainable?

When you run into a problem you more often than not don't really know where to start. You stab around in the dark until you find a solution. But that often takes hours or even longer.

You know that you can level-up and become a real pro. But here you are still feeling like an amateur.

## What if you had help learning professional skills?

It would be so much easier to improve your code
